1. What is a console app?
A console application is an application that runs in a Command Prompt window instead of providing a graphical user interface (GUI).

2. What does Main () (the main method) do in a console application?
The Main method designates the program’s entry point.  C# is a case sensitive language.  You must spell Main with an uppercase M.

3. What is the purpose of a namespace?
Namespaces help solve this problem by creating a container for items such as classes. Two classes with the same name will not be confused with each other if the live in different namespaces.  A package is another name for it.

4. Describe specifically what using statements do?
A using directive brings a namespace into scope.  In a subsequent code in the same file, one no longer needs to explicitly qualify objects with the namespace to which they belong.  Classes that are used so often, Visual Studio 2015 automatically adds these using directives every time one creates a new project.

5. What is an assembly?
A block of compiled codes. An assembly is a file that usually has the .dll file name extension, although strictly speaking, executable programs with the .exe file name extension are also assemblies.

6. What is the relationship between an assembly and a namespace?
There is no relationship.  A namespace can contain several assemblies.

7. What is a graphical app?
These are templates that are referred as Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps.  They enable one to create apps that function on any device that runs Windows, such as desktops computers, tablets, and phones.

8. What is the starting point in a graphical application?
Does not have a name function.  XAML

9. What does Build do?
It turns it into an assembly. It is an action that compiles the C# code, resulting in a program that one can run.

10. What does Debug do?
Show errors…goes through it line-by-line to check it.
